## Aayush Singh's Capstone Project

The project’s main goal will be on development of an intelligent price tracker and analytics platform for online shopping called Jynx. The main idea is to keep track of products on big sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and Steam (provides digital licenses of PC Games) all in one place so you don't have to deal with prices that change all the time and fake reviews. This project will be utilizing a custom web scraping engine and a fast API backend, and a responsive Next.js frontend. Now, the feature which makes this project unique is the Artificial Intelligence & Business Intelligence Analytics Integrations. So, it will have an inbuilt AI chat system or ai agents based chat built on RAG architecture that will give users personalised shopping advices and recommendations, and it will also have a Power BI dashboard for looking at market trends and consumer interests for further analysis and forecasting.
